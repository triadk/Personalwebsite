        <h2>New Mission: Software Development</h2>
        <p>In July of this year, I made the decision to expand my horizon and learn <br> something i have never thought I'd be apart of. I've always enjoyed anything dealing with computers whether it was software, <br>programs,websites,etc. Now i get the opportunity to learn many things from software development. Such as, <br> creating webpages, embeding links to your creations, and creating forms.I am very new to this so it can be <br>overwhelming, but i'm willing to putting the effort into learning the new skills that will launch me into a new career.</p>
